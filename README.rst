This is just included at the moment for the purpose of having a quick CLI readme 
at the ready.  However, there is a full set of documentation available elsewhere

.. todo: 
    Add some info about how and where to find the documentation.

Installation
------------

The most simple way to install this is using the included Python ``setup.py`` 
script by running: ::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

.. note:
    Only will need `sudo` for system wide isntalls of course. Also, note that PIP
    will not work for this package at the moment since it seems to get a little 
    crabby with the postinstaller scripts.

Once setup is running, you'll have to configure the package with a postinstaller
script.
